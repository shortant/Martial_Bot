Chat Bot Connected To Chat GPT 3.5 turbo specified for increasing sign ups to MartialArts Dojo


The chatbot in this repository is developed using BotPress, an AI integration tool that enables users to program nodes corresponding to different conversation paths on a given topic. Its primary objective is to enhance traffic to a potential martial arts class by providing users with information about various classes, special offers, and other essential details necessary before enrolling in the program. To enrich the conversational experience and handle unprogrammed inquiries, the chatbot integrates ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, a knowledge-rich AI capable of generating answers to a wide array of questions, even those not explicitly programmed into the bot or covered by its generative knowledge FAQ.</n>

The process of building this chatbot, though not excessively complex, demands precision and attention to detail. Each node must be interconnected to previous nodes in a manner that ensures the flow of conversation remains natural and coherent to end users. While my expertise mainly lies in Python notation, BotPress employs JavaScript to implement switch statements for handling responses from users. Embracing newer IDEs allowed me to challenge myself in an unfamiliar domain. BotPress' node pathing relies on variables created in the bot, enabling it to follow logical formulas and retain past user responses. By storing each conversation's variable pathing, the bot can respond with personalized messages, making the conversation flow seem more natural and maintaining continuity.

The most challenging aspect of this project is maintaining consistency in the pathing of each node. As the choices given to users can lead to unique paths with vastly different outcomes, keeping track of the pathways is essential to prevent incoherence or incorrect responses to inquiries. Rigorous testing is a recurring necessity during each step of the bot's development to ensure that a node's pathing has not been misplaced, variables have not been named incorrectly, and conversations do not end prematurely.

The chatbot presented today embodies an artificial liaison named Sarah, who connects potential clients to more information about classes, particularly if specific details are not readily available on the website. Integrating such bots into websites offers companies a failsafe in case human representatives cannot be reached. Leveraging readily available AI for direct conversations can significantly reduce business churn rates. The primary nodes of this project guide the customer down a path tailored to their needs or preferences. Based on whether the end-user wants to sign up for classes themselves or for their children, two separate branches are opened, each with unique dialogue options that ensure personalized responses based on the user's answers. While customers are aware they are interacting with a bot, infusing a personal touch in the bot's responses engages potential clients actively during their inquiries about the business.

Businesses want to avoid losing potential sales due to system failures in responding adequately to customer needs. Towards the end of the conversation path, the bot is accompanied by a generative knowledge AI, which utilizes a .txt file containing FAQs to address any unprogrammed inputs made by the user after providing base information. Occasionally, the scope of questions may surpass the bot's pre-programmed answers and even the FAQ provided by the company. For redundancy, Stack AI proves to be immensely helpful in integrating text-based AI systems like Chat GPT into bots like this one to tackle questions that the bot may not be readily equipped to answer. Although the bot wasn't specifically programmed to address inquiries about, for instance, the history of martial arts, Chat GPT can be called upon within the system to provide information in areas where the bot might be lacking.

Finally, one of the most critical integrations involves Zapier hooks, which were incorporated into the bot to scrape conversations and extract user-provided emails and names, storing them in a Google sheet. This practice enables companies to maintain an organized list of potential clients, facilitating the delivery of information packets, special offers, or direct contact by the business. Clients engaging with the bot have a higher likelihood of converting into actual customers, making the retention of information on potential leads a substantial advantage in expanding clientele and retaining existing customers.
